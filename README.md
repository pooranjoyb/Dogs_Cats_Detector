# Dog and Cat Image Classifier
This project is a machine learning model that detects images of dogs and cats and predicts the image as either a dog or a cat. It uses the Keras library on top of TensorFlow to create a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that can accurately classify the images.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [Dogs & Cats Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unmoved/30k-cats-and-dogs-150x150-greyscale) dataset from Kaggle. It consists of 30,000 labeled images of dogs and cats, with 15,000 images of each animal. The images are of different sizes and aspect ratios, and are in JPG format.

## Tech Stack
- Flask
- Reactjs
- Python 
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
